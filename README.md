## Research Work
### Machine Learning and NLP
* Research on Neural Machine Translation, Language Generation/Understanding, Seq2Seq Learning, etc. 
* Pubish 40+ papers on top conferences, multiple technologies transferred into Bing Search and Bing Translation. 
* Achieving human parity on [Chinese-English news translation](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/chinese-to-english-translator-milestone/). 
* Winning champions in [WMT Machine Translation Competition](https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2019/05/22/microsoft-research-asia-msra-leads-in-2019-wmt-international-machine-translation-competition/) in 2019. 
### Pre-training for Language Understanding and Generation
* Publish 8 papers on top conferences, pre-training model [MASS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02450.pdf) deployed in Bing Ads for Ads content generation, and deployed in Bing Translation for low-resource languages. 
* MASS is one of the most impactful models in pre-training, with 400+ citations, top cited papers in ICML 2019. [MPNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09297.pdf) (NeurIPS 2020) adopted by [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/mpnet.html).
### Speech Synthesis and Recognition
* Publish 20+ papers on top conferences, multiple technologies (FastSpeech 1/2, LRSpeech, AdaSpeech 1/2/3, FastCorrect 1/2) deployed in Microsoft Azure TTS and ASR services.  
* [FastSpeech 1/2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/fastspeech-new-text-to-speech-model-improves-on-speed-accuracy-and-controllability/) (NeurIPS 2019/ICLR 2021) are one of the most important techniques in TTS community, with totally 400+ citations, widely adopted in academia and industry. Integrated in ESPNet (4.1K Github Star), NVIDIA Nemo (3.2K Github Star), TensorFlowTTS (2.2K Github Star), Baidu PaddlePaddle. Demo by [NVIDIA GTC 2020](https://resource.gtcevent.cn/gtc2020/pdf/CNS20269.pdf). 
* [Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15561.pdf), [talks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), and [tutorials](https://tts-tutorial.github.io/ijcai2021/) on TTS influence wide researchers and engineers in TTS community. 
### Music Understanding and Generation
* Publish 10+ papers on top conferences, multiple techniques (SongMASS, StrcutMelody, DeepRapper, XiaoiceSing, and HiFiSinger) integrated in Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Xiaoice for AI music composition. 
* Systematic research on songwriting, accompaniment and arrangement, singing voice synthesis, music understanding, etc. Keynote speaker on [AI music composition](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0ef2Xn7oSGYlip7LEzHXog) at GAITC 2021. Tutorial on AI music composition in ACM MM 2021.
