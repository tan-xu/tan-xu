## Research Work
### Machine Learning and NLP
* Research on Neural Machine Translation, Language Generation/Understanding, Seq2Seq Learning, etc. 
* Multiple technologies transferred into Bing Search and Bing Translation. 
* Achieving human parity on [Chinese-English news translation](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/chinese-to-english-translator-milestone/). 
* Winning champions in [WMT Machine Translation Competition](https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2019/05/22/microsoft-research-asia-msra-leads-in-2019-wmt-international-machine-translation-competition/) in 2019. 
### Pre-training for Language Understanding and Generation
* Pre-training model [MASS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02450.pdf) deployed in Bing Ads for Ads content generation and deployed in Bing Translation for low-resource languages. 
* MASS is one of the most impactful models in pre-training, with 700+ citations, top cited papers in ICML 2019.
### Speech Synthesis and Recognition
* Multiple research work (FastSpeech 1/2, LRSpeech, AdaSpeech 1/2/3, DelightfulTTS, FastCorrect 1/2) deployed in Microsoft Azure TTS and ASR services.  
* [FastSpeech 1/2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/fastspeech-new-text-to-speech-model-improves-on-speed-accuracy-and-controllability/) (NeurIPS 2019/ICLR 2021) are one of the most important techniques in TTS community, widely adopted in academia and industry. Integrated in some popular Github repos, such as ESPNet, NVIDIA Nemo, TensorFlowTTS, Baidu PaddlePaddle Parakeet. Demo by [NVIDIA GTC 2020](https://resource.gtcevent.cn/gtc2020/pdf/CNS20269.pdf). 
* [Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15561), [talks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), and [tutorials](https://github.com/tts-tutorial/) on TTS influence wide researchers and engineers in TTS community. 
* [NaturaSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04421) achieves human-level quality on text-to-speech synthesis on LJSpeech dataset for the first time. 
* Speech project demo page: https://speechresearch.github.io/, code opensource page: https://github.com/microsoft/NeuralSpeech.
### Music Understanding and Generation 
* Systematic research on songwriting, accompaniment and arrangement, singing voice synthesis, music understanding, etc.
* Multiple technologies (TeleMelody, MeloForm, DeepRapper, XiaoiceSing, and HiFiSinger) integrated in Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Xiaoice for AI music composition.
* Muzic: our research project on AI music, https://github.com/microsoft/muzic.
* [CLaMP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11029.pdf) won the best student paper award at ISMIR 2023.
